intro5 = Bana göre hoş, canım. But we'll be the ones who win the [icon:trophy][trophy]annual bird movie award[/trophy], mark my word!

passport0 = Muhteşem! Müthiş! This trophy is everything I desire... on the shelf in my living room!
passport1 = Of course, this big trophy is just a plastic replica! The actual trophy is really tiny!

passport3 = Oh, hayır. Bu sadece küçük bir kız. Merhaba!
passport3b = Oh, hayır. Bu sadece küçük bir çocuk. Merhaba!

hth_intro2 = Now, I can understand if you feel they belong to you, darling. I understand. But did you know they allow for rewinding time?
hth_intro3 = With one [icon:timepiece][timepiece]Time Piece[/timepiece], I could reclaim all the trophies that belong to me, darling. Every single trophy I've lost to the [icon:conductor][name]Kondüktör[/name], where he has cheated his way to victory.
hth_intro4 = I can't prove it, darling, but I'm certain the [icon:conductor][name]Kondüktör[/name] has been manipulating everything to make sure I never win.

hth_intro6b = Canım, canım, canım. Sen kalıcı olarak çok bencilsin. I've brought you to stardom, and all I ask in return is a single [icon:timepiece][timepiece]Time Piece[/timepiece]... but you won't share?

Endorsement_Statue2 = This is truly a diva I can get behind. Let it be known that this lil' girl is all about animals!

Endorsement_Poker0 = Watch as she beats these hard-boiled card players at their own game... on her first try!
Endorsement_Poker1 = This game is easy to understand, darling. You just guess which number of card the other player is holding, from [hint]1 to 10[/hint]. Which card do you think he's holding, darling?
Endorsement_Poker2 = Wow! Fantastic! Incredible! The answer is indeed [hint]3[/hint]! Folks at home, you have just witnessed the stunning intuition of a true star.
Endorsement_Poker3 = Aww, too bad, darling! The answer was [hint]3[/hint]! Folks at home, this just shows that our new break-out star is relatable. She makes mistakes just like everyone else!

Endorsement_Cooking0 = Şimdi, canım, I have to mention this. Yemek programı hosts have a terrible track record of getting angry and swearing on-screen. P-word'ü kullanmamaya çalış, OK? p-e-c-k deme.
Endorsement_Cooking1 = [icon:conductor][name]Kondüktör[/name] modası geçti. He throws that word around a lot. It'll get him in trouble some day! O zamana kadar, haydi şovumuzu temiz tutalım.

Endorsement_Cooking7 = [small]Şimdi şu, get out of this endorsement as soon as you can,[br]before the old penguins watching TV notice what just happened.[/small]

Endorsement_Alley0 = Look at how street-smart this diva is. She's standing in this sinister alleyway, right next to some potential wrongdoers!
Endorsement_Alley1 = Danger is her middle name, and she's not afraid to step outside of her comfort zone!

Ending0 = Seyirci çılgına döndü, canım! Buraya gel ve show off our new stunner... our [icon:timepiece][timepiece]new prop[/timepiece]!

[finale]
